# Punk Accessibility

A skill for creating protest forms anyone can replicate without resources, training, or permission.

## When to Use

- When you want actions that scale through replication
- When participants have limited resources
- When professionalism has become a barrier to participation
- When raw authenticity matters more than polish

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| input_data | Yes | The primary data or content to analyze |
| context | No | Additional background or constraints (default: none) |
| output_format | No | Preferred format for results (default: structured markdown) |

## Workflow
### Step 1: Phase 1: Strip to Essentials

Remove everything unnecessary:
- What's the minimum needed for the action to happen?
- What equipment can be substituted or eliminated?
- What skills can be learned in minutes rather than years?
- What preparation can be done in hours rather than months?

If someone asks "but don't you need..." the answer should usually be "no."

### Step 2: Phase 2: Replace Professionalism with Authenticity

Reframe amateur as feature:
- Raw emotional expression over polished delivery
- DIY aesthetics as intentional choice
- Mistakes as evidence of realness
- "You could do this" as the message

The polish of traditional media creates distance. Remove the distance.

### Step 3: Phase 3: Create the Toolkit

Make participation as easy as possible:
- Step-by-step instructions anyone can follow
- Templates, scripts, and examples
- List of what you actually need (short)
- Common problems and solutions

The toolkit should enable first-time participation.

### Step 4: Phase 4: Enable Adaptation

Build in flexibility:
- Principles rather than rigid procedures
- Multiple options for each step
- Encouragement to modify for local context
- Explicit permission to change what doesn't work

The form should evolve through use, not resist modification.

### Step 5: Phase 5: Celebrate All Attempts

Build culture that welcomes imperfection:
- Amplify participation regardless of quality
- Share beginner attempts alongside experienced ones
- Never criticize someone for trying
- The act of participation is the achievement

Perfectionism kills movements. Celebrate showing up.

## Output Format

A punk accessibility design including:
1. The action stripped to its essentials
2. What was removed and why it wasn't needed
3. The minimal toolkit
4. Adaptation guidelines
5. Examples at various skill levels
6. Distribution and encouragement strategy

## Constraints

- Some actions genuinely require skills or resources - acknowledge this
- Safety training may be non-negotiable
- Legal preparation matters even for accessible actions
- Accessibility doesn't mean carelessness
- Some contexts (disability, location, risk) create real barriers that shouldn't be minimized

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input**: Make documentary filmmaking accessible for citizen journalism

**Output**:
"Stripped essentials: A phone, a subject, basic story structure (problem, people, what's being done). That's it. Removed: Professional camera, lighting, sound equipment, editing software, training, budget. Why not needed: Phone cameras are good enough for evidence. Natural light works. Phone mics work for interviews. Free editing apps exist. You learn by doing. Toolkit: 1) Find someone affected by the issue. 2) Ask them to tell their story. 3) Film while they talk. 4) Film what they show you. 5) Ask 'what do you want people to know?' 6) Post with minimal editing. Adaptation: Works for any injustice. Adjust length to platform. Collaborate if someone else has skills you don't. Examples shown: Range from first-attempts to experienced work, all valued. Distribution: Post toolkit everywhere, run 'make a doc this weekend' challenges, amplify all attempts."

## Integration

Works with:
- **collective-action-design**: Accessibility enables collective scale
- **spectacular-transgression**: Even dramatic actions can be made accessible
- **documentation-as-resistance**: Accessible documentation methods create more documenters
